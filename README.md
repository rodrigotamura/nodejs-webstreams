# About

For study purpose, let's try Nodejs' webstream which is able to read huge files and printing out on web.
In this approach we'll read a CSV file.

# Try it

```bash
git clone git@github.com:rodrigotamura/nodejs-webstreams.git
cd nodejs-webstreams
npm install

// running server at port 8000
cd server
npm run dev
cd ..

// running app
cd app
npm run start

// open browser at http://localhost:8080

```
